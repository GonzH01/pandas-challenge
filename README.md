# pandas-challenge

In this Jupyter Lab project, we analyze a school district's data by combining information about schools and their students. Our focus is on understanding different aspects of school performance, including how much money is spent per student and the size of each school. We look closely at students' math and reading scores across all grades from 9th to 12th and see how these scores vary with school spending, school type and size. The project aims to find out if there's a link between how much schools spend and how well students do academically. This analysis is helpful for school administrators and decision-makers, giving them a clear picture of where schools stand and what might be improved. We use Python and its pandas library for all the data processing and analysis, making this project a useful example of handling educational data effectively.
